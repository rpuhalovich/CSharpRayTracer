# CSharpRayTracer

This is a ray tracer written in C# as part of a university assignment. We were given template code that set up the IO of the program, however all of the ray tracing logic was researched and implemented by me, as per the assignment spec.

The original readme (`ORIGINAL_README.md`) was provided by the university and filled out me. Marking can be seen at the bottom.

## Getting Started

Scripts can be found in the `scripts` directory that render different scenes in the `images` directory.
